## This script will do the following:
## merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
## extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
## use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
## appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names 
## creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable 
## for each activity and each subject from that data set

## The desired text files have already been put into the current working directory
## using Bash in Terminal

features <- read.table("features.txt", header=FALSE)
## reads in a 2x561 table with all variable names
## ## Anthony's test merge
xtest <- read.table("X_test.txt", header=FALSE, sep="")
## reads in the test (approx 30% of) data
## its dimensions are 2947x561

xtrain <- read.table("X_train.txt", header=FALSE, sep="")
## reads in the training (approx 70% of) data
## its dimensions are 7352x561

ytest <- read.table("Y_test.txt", header=FALSE)
## reads in the activity names (numbers for now) for the test data
## its dimensions are 2947x1

ytrain <- read.table("Y_train.txt", header=FALSE)
## reads in the activity names (numbers for now) for the training data
## its dimensions are 7352x1

featuresColnames<-t(features)
## creates a new table using the transpose command to make it 561x2
## now all of the names are going across in a row to better match up with the data

colnames(xtest) <- featuresColnames[2,]
## puts all names across the top of the xtest data
## only row 2 has the names
## these are the descriptive variable names
## required in #4 of the assignment

colnames(xtrain) <- featuresColnames[2,]
## puts all names across the top of the xtrain data
## only row 2 has the names
## this step isn't really necessary since this will
## be merged with xtest which already has the appropriate column names

## the two data frames will be put together 

allmerged <- rbind(xtest,xtrain)

## its dimensions are 10299 x 562
## (the extra column came from the activity type)
## this was the correct number of observations as reported on the phone data website
